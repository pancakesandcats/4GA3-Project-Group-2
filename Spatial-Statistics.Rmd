 The Spatial Moving Average (SMA) map for food stamp usage reveals a clear spatial clustering pattern, particularly concentrated in the southern and southwestern regions of Texas. These clusters are characterized by darker shading, indicating that high food stamp usage is not randomly distributed but spatially grouped. This visual pattern is further supported when compared to the randomized null SMA map, which lacks any coherent structure or concentration, reinforcing the idea that the observed clustering is meaningful rather than due to chance. When the food stamp map is visually compared to the SMA maps for racial demographics, some alignment emerges, but the degree of overlap varies across groups. For example, the Black population displays strong clustering in the eastern part of the state, where there is also notable food stamp usage, suggesting a potential spatial relationship. The white population is more heavily clustered in central and northwestern Texas, with only partial overlap in the southwest, where some food stamp clustering also appears. Other racial groups — including Asian, American Indian, Pacific Islander, and those categorized as “Other” — show more dispersed or minimal clustering, making spatial comparisons less conclusive. Overall, while visual analysis of the SMA maps highlights several potential co-located clusters, especially for the Black population, these observations remain exploratory. The spatial clustering suggests areas of concentrated socio-economic vulnerability, but the strength of the relationship between race and food stamp usage would require more rigorous statistical testing to confirm.
